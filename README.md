# Eventbase - QA Analyst Challenge

Yeah, we are so excited to have you here for this little coding challenge. And before you start getting worried, it's not called a *challenge* because it's difficult. We call it a challenge because we want to challenge you to provide a solution that you feel proud of and reflect the way that you like to develop.

All we want to achieve with this coding challenge is to provide a basis for our conversation with you and get an idea of what the things are that you care about as a QA analyst and how you approach solving problems.

-------

## Objective

Eventbase Foundation QA team creates automated solutions for testing a complex, single page internal application.  
We would like you to build a Cypress.io(https://www.cypress.io/) -based application that would automate the following test cases for *https://giphy.com/* (an application similar in complexity to our platform):  

1. User can create a new account  
2. 'Invalid Email' error prompt appears if user enters an invalid email during login  
3. As a signed in user, I can successfully log out  
4. As a signed in user, I can search for 'Canada' and favourite the #canada image  
5. As a signed in user, I can unfavourite an image from the Favorites Screen (https://giphy.com/favorites)  
6. Webpage sends `'is_public' = false` to backend when toggling from Public to Private channel setting (https://giphy.com/settings)
7. As a signed in user, I can upload an image and create a new giphy image with 'FQA test test' text.
